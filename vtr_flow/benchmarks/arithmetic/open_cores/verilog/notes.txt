YES:
	md5_piplined
		18.7k total logic elements
	piplined_fft_64 - {forward, inverse} fast fourier transform - 128 & 256 bits available, also
		4.8k total logic elements
	verilog_cordic_core - calcs trig functions using Volder's algorithm
		1.1k total logic elements
		tunable (more iterations -> larger)
		has one generate loop, and functions
	rc4-prbs - generates a pseudo random byte stream using rc4
		7.1k total logic elements

YES, BUT NO (TO SMALL):
	ima_adpcm_enc_dec - IMA Adaptive differential pulse-code modulation
		enc: 0.38k total logic elements
		dec: 0.21k total logic elements 
	fht
		fast hadamard transform
		0.039k total logic elements
		*tiny*

MAYBE:
	cavlc - Context-adaptive variable-length coding
		very few add/sub
	dvb_s2_ldpc_decoder - Digital Video Broadcasting - Satellite - Second Generation, Low-Density Parity-Check decoder
		a few adders
		huge
		but many generate loops
	vitdec - Configurable High Speed Viterbi Decoder
		39.9k total logic elements
		but many arrays and generate loops

NO:
	pid_controller - has mult and add, but it's defined combinationally
	sha3 - mostly xors
	fpga-median - no adding
