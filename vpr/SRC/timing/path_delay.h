#define SLACK_DEFINITION 'R'
/* Choose how to normalize negative slacks for the optimizers (not in the final timing analysis for output statistics):
   'R' (T_req-relaxed): For each constraint, set the required time at sink nodes to the max of the true required time 
	   (constraint + tnode[inode].clock_skew) and the max arrival time. This means that the required time is "relaxed" 
	   to the max arrival time for tight constraints which would otherwise give negative slack.
   'I' (Improved Shifted): After all slacks are computed, increase the value of all slacks by the magnitude of the 
	   largest negative slack, if it exists. More computationally demanding. Equivalent to 'R' for a single clock. 
   'S' (Shifted): Same as improved shifted, but criticalities are only computed after all traversals.  Equivalent to 'R'
	   for a single clock.
   'G' (Global T_req-relaxed): Same as T_req-relaxed, but criticalities are only computed after all traversals.  
	   Equivalent to 'R' for a single clock.  Note: G is a global version of R, just like S is a global version of I.
   'C' (Clipped): All negative slacks are clipped to 0. 
   'N' (None): Negative slacks are not normalized. 

   This definition also affects how criticality is computed.  For all methods except 'S', the criticality denominator 
   is the maximum required time for each constraint, and criticality is updated after each constraint.  'S' only updates
   criticalities once after all traversals, and the criticality denominator is the maximum required time over all 
   traversals.  

   Because the criticality denominator must be >= the largest slack it is used on, and slack normalization affects the
   size of the largest slack, the denominator must also be normalized.  We choose the following normalization methods:

   'R': Denominator is already taken care of because the maximum required time now depends on the constraint. No further
		normalization is necessary.
   'I': Denominator is increased by the magnitude of the largest negative slack.
   'S': Denominator is the maximum of the 'I' denominator over all constraints.
   'G': Denominator is the maximum of the 'R' denominator over all constraints.
   'C': Denominator is unchanged.  However, if Treq_max is 0, there is division by 0.  To avoid this, note that in this
		case, all of the slacks will be clipped to zero anyways, so we can just set the criticality to 1. 
   'N': Denominator is set to max(max_Treq, max_Tarr), so that the magnitude of criticality will at least be bounded to 
		2.  This is the same denominator as 'R', though calculated differently.
