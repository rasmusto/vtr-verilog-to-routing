= VersaPower: Power Estimation for VTR=

*`***`IMPORTANT: Currently the power estimation code resides in a branch, which is a few months old, and not up to date with the trunk.  Over the next month, this branch will be integrated into the trunk.`***`*

==Download==

The code can be downloaded from:
svn/branches/Power_JeffG/


== Source Code ==

VersaPower source code is located here:
  * vtr_flow/vpr/SRC/power/power.c
  * vtr_flow/vpr/SRC/power/power.h

==Compiling ==

Compile Project:
<code>
`make`</code>

==Run VTR flow with VersaPower==
<code>vtr_flow/scripts/run_vtr_flow.pl <verilog> <architecture> -power -cmos_tech <tech_xml></code>

Example:
<code>
vtr_flow/scripts/run_vtr_flow.pl vtr_flow/benchmarks/verilog/ch_intrinsics.v vtr_flow/arch/power/k6_N10_I33_Fi6_L4_frac1_ff2_45nm.xml -power -cmos_tech vtr_flow/tech/PTM_45nm/45nm.xml </code>

==Output==

Power information will be created in <code>temp/<circuit_name>.power</code>
