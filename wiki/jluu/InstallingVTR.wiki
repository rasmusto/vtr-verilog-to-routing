#summary Instruction on installing VTR.

= Requirements =
VTR can be installed in 32-bit or 64-bit Linux, or Cygwin.  However, large benchmarks may require more than 4GB of virtual memory, and will fail to run in 32-bit Linux or Cygwin. 

= Downloading and Installing VTR =

  # Download the VTR package [http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/vtr/terms.html here]
  # Unpack to a directory of your choice (Hereafter referred to as {{{<vtr>}}})
  # Navigate to {{{<vtr>}}} and run <code>make</code>

= Verifying Installation =
To verify that VTR has been installed correctly, run:
<code>{{{<vtr>}}}/vtr_flow/scripts/run_vtr_task.pl basic_flow</code>

The expected output is:
<code>
k6_N10_memSize16384_memData64_40nm_timing/ch_intrinsics...OK
</code>

If the task does not report 'OK', please check the [FAQ FAQ Page] before raising an issue.

_Explanation:_ The above test will run the task named *basic_flow*.  This task will run a single benchmark through the entire VTR flow from verilog to routing.  The output of the task is formatted as {{{<architecture>}}}/{{{<benchmark>}}}...{{{<status>}}}.  For more information see [RunningVTR Running VTR].
