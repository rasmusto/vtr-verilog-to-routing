= parse_vtr_flow.pl =

== Overview ==
This script parses statistics following the execution of single VTR flow.  If the user is using the task framework, [Parse_VTR_Task parse_vtr_task.pl] should be used instead. 

The script is located here:
<code>
`<vtr>/vtr_flow/scripts/parse_vtr_flow.pl`
</code>

==Usage==
The usage is:
<code>
parse_vtr_flow.pl <parse_path> <parse_config_file> 
</code>

*parse_path*: Directory path that contains the files that will be parsed (vpr.out, odin.out, etc).

*parse_config_file*: Path to the [ParseFiles Parse Configuration File].

==Output==
The script will produce no standard output.  A single file named parse_results.txt will be produced in the `<parse_path>` folder.  The file is tab delimited and contains two lines.  The first line is a list of field names that were searched for, and the second line contains the associated values.
